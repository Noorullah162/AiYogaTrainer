Introduction
This project aims to help users practice yoga by providing real-time feedback on their poses. Using a webcam, the application captures the user's movements and utilizes TensorFlow-based pose estimation to analyze the accuracy of the poses. The system provides both visual cues on the video feed and auditory instructions to guide users in adjusting their posture.

Features
Real-time video processing using webcam.
Pose estimation and analysis with TensorFlow Movenet model.
Visual feedback with skeletal overlay and pose accuracy indicators.
Auditory feedback using pyttsx3 to provide real-time instructions.
User-friendly web interface with Flask.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later
Flask
OpenCV
